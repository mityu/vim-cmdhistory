==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*cmdhistory-introduction*

*cmdhistory* is a fuzzy finder plugin to select command from history on
command-line and command-line window.  The target is the all you can input on
command-line such as commands, search patterns, and |input()| prompts.


==============================================================================
REQUIREMENTS					*cmdhistory-requirements*

Vim 9.0.2129 or later.  Be careful that Vim may crash on prior version.


==============================================================================
FUNCTIONS						*cmdhistory-functions*

cmdhistory#Select()					*cmdhistory#Select()*
	Start command history selection.  Open command history selector window
	and wait for user inputs.

						*cmdhistory#MapAction()*
cmdhistory#MapAction({key}: string, {actions}: list<string>)
	Map a key to a sequence of actions.  {key} is a single key to be
	mapped and {actions} is a sequence of actions to be executed on key
	typed. Actions specified to {actions} are executed in the order
	they're specified.
	Different from Vim's mapping system, there're two limitations for this
	function.
	- You can only map a single key and cannot map a key sequence.  Here,
	  "a single key" means what |popup-filter| gives in one callback.
	- You cannot map <C-c> because it's reserved for quit action.

	Examples: >
	# Select present item with <Tab>
	cmdhistory#MapAction('<Tab>', ['accept'])

	# Clear all input on prompt with <C-k>.
	cmdhistory#MapAction('<C-k>', ['go-tail', 'delete-to-head'])
<

						*cmdhistory#UnmapAction()*
cmdhistory#UnmapAction({key}: string)
	Remove key binding for {key}.  {key} should be what specified in
	|cmdhistory#MapAction()|.

					*cmdhistory#SetDefaultMappings()*
cmdhistory#SetDefaultMappings()
	Set default mappings.  You can call this function on
	|cmdhistory-initialize| event if you want to set this plugin's default
	mappings.  The list of default mappings is here:

	 key 	       actions
	=====	=====================
	<CR>	["accept"]
	<C-f>	["go-forward"]
	<C-b>	["go-backward"]
	<C-a>	["go-head"]
	<C-e>	["go-tail"]
	<C-h>	["delete-character"]
	<BS>	["delete-character"]
	<Del>	["delete-character"]
	<C-w>	["delete-word"]
	<C-u>	["delete-to-head"]
	<C-p>	["select-prev-item"]
	<C-n>	["select-next-item"]
	<C-k>	["select-prev-item"]
	<C-j>	["select-next-item"]
	<C-l>	["redraw"]


==============================================================================
DEFAULT MAPPINGS				*cmdhistory-default-mappings*

This plugin doesn't provide default mappings except for <C-c> on selector
window, which is to quit this plugin.  You should call
|cmdhistory#MapAction()| to add your original mappings or
|cmdhistory#SetDefaultMappings()| to set some default mappings on
|cmdhistory-initialize| event.


==============================================================================
AUTOCOMMANDS					*cmdhistory-autocommands*

*cmdhistory* provides a |User| autocommand for customization.

cmdhistory-initialize				*cmdhistory-initialize*
	Invoked once on first launch of this plugin.  You can configure some
	settings such as keybindings with this autocommand.


==============================================================================
BUILTIN ACTIONS				*cmdhistory-builtin-actions*

This is the list of default provided actions.

accept					*cmdhistory-builtin-action-accept*
	Accept the present candidate.  Close the selector window and set
	selected item to command-line or set selected item to new empty line
	on command-line window.

quit					*cmdhistory-builtin-action-quit*
	Close the selector window and abort history selection.

redraw					*cmdhistory-builtin-action-redraw*
	Redraw the selector window.

select-next-item		*cmdhistory-builtin-action-select-next-item*
	Select the next item on the selector window.  "Next item" means the
	line above on window here.

select-prev-item		*cmdhistory-builtin-action-select-prev-item*
	Select the previous item on the selector window.  "Previous item"
	means the line below on window here.

go-forward			*cmdhistory-builtin-action-go-forward*
	Go cursor forward for one character on prompt.

go-backward			*cmdhistory-builtin-action-go-backward*
	Go cursor backward for one character on prompt.

go-head					*cmdhistory-builtin-action-go-head*
	Go cursor the head of line on prompt.

go-tail					*cmdhistory-builtin-action-go-tail*
	Go cursor the end of line on prompt.

delete-character		*cmdhistory-builtin-action-delete-character*
	Delete a character before cursor on prompt.

delete-word			*cmdhistory-builtin-action-delete-word*
	Delete a word before cursor on prompt.

delete-to-head			*cmdhistory-builtin-action-delete-to-head*
	Delete all characters before cursor on prompt.

no-operation			*cmdhistory-builtin-action-no-operation*
	Do nothing.  |<Nop>| for this plugin.


==============================================================================
MATCHING ALGORITHM			*cmdhistory-matching-algorithm*

User input is treated as space separated list of |regexp|s and only items
matches for the every given |regexp| will only remain as filtered items. E.g.
	- Input: "\<h\w*"
		Items matches the regexp "\<h\w*" will remain. For example:
		- Item "good evening": removed
			"good evening" does not matches the regexp.
		- Item "hello": remain
			"hello" matches the regexp "\<h\w*"
		- Item "hello cmdhistory.vim": remain
			"hello cmdhistory.vim" matches the regexp "\<h\w*"
	- Input: "\<h\w* \.vim$"
		Items matches the both regexp "\<h\w*" and "\.vim$" will
		remain. For example:
		- Item "good evening": removed
			"good evening" does not matches any of the regexps.
		- Item "hello": removed
			"hello" matches "\<h\w*" but doesn't match "\.vim$"
		- Item "hello cmdhistory.vim": remain
			"hello cmdhistory.vim" matches the both of regexps.
To include space in match pattern, you can escape that with "\":
	- Input: "^hello\ world$"
		- Item "hello world": remain
			"hello world" matches the regexp "^hello world$".
		- Item "hello new world": removed
			"hello new world" doesn't match the regexp
			"^hello world$".
Additionally, to include backslash itself in match pattern, use "\\":
	- Input: "\\"
		- Item "C:\path\to\fileA": remain
			This string have backslashes.
		- Item "/path/to/fileB": removed
			This string doesn't contain backslashes.
